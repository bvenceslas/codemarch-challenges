    <h3 style="color: darkgreen">Project 1: Responsive Website</h3>

    <p>
      I designed and developed a responsive website for a local business using
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site features a clean layout and is
      optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

    <h3 style="color: darkgreen">Project 2: E-commerce Platform</h3>
    <p>
      For this project, I worked with a team to create a custom e-commerce
      platform using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a back-end framework. The
      platform allows customers to browse products, add items to their cart, and
      complete purchases.
