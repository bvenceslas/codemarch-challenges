    <h1>The Wonders of Nature</h1>
    <h2>Exploring the Beauty of Our Planet</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Earth</strong> is home to a myriad of amazing natural wonders,
      from vast oceans and towering mountains to dense forests and arid deserts.
      In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at some of the most
      <u>incredible</u>
      natural phenomena our planet has to offer.
    </p>

    <h2>The Great Barrier Ref</h2>

    <p>
      Located off the coast of <strong>Queensland, Australia</strong>, the
      <em>Great Barrier</em> Reef is the largest coral reef system in the world.
      It stretches over 2,300 kilometers (1,400 miles) and is home to a diverse
      array of marine life, including more than 1,500 species of fish, 411 types
      of hard coral, and 30 species of whales and dolphins
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      The Great Barrier Reef is a site of remarkable variety and beauty on the
      north-east coast of Australia. It contains the world's largest collection
      of coral reefs, with 400 types of coral, 1,500 species of fish and 4,000
      types of mollusk. <br />

    <h2>The Amazon Rainforest</h2>

    <p>
      The <em>Amazon Rainforest</em> is the world's largest tropical rainforest,
      covering an area of approximately 6.7 million square kilometers (2.7
      million square miles) in South America. In fact, it is estimated that
      <del>ont-third</del> <ins>one-fifth</ins> of all known species on our
      planet can be found in the Amazon.
    </p>

    <p>
      One fascinating fact about the Amazon Rainforest is that it produces "20%
      of the world's oxygen" and plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's
      climate. However, it is also under threat from
      <sub>deforestation</sub> and climate change, which could have devastating
      consequences for the entire planet.

    <h2>Mount Everest</h2>

    <p>
      Standing at an impressive 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) above sea level,
      <strong>Mount Everest</strong> is the highest peak on Earth
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite the many challenges and risks associated with climbing Mount
      Everest, it remains a popular destination for adventure-seekers from
      around the world. In fact, it is estimated that over
      <sup>4,000</sup> people have successfully reached the summit since Sir
      Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay first did so in 1953.
