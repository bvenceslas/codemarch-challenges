      <h2>My Travel Experience</h2>
      <p>Posted on May 10, 2023 by codemarch</p>

      <article>
        Last month, I visited Japan for the first time. It was an amazing
        experience! I fell in love with the culture, food, and people. In this
        post, I'd like to share some highlights from my trip.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Tokyo: The bustling city with its bright lights and busy streets was
            unforgettable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Kyoto: A city filled with ancient temples and beautiful gardens,
            Kyoto was a peaceful retreat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Osaka: Known for its delicious street food and friendly locals,
            Osaka was a food lover's paradise.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I can't wait to return to Japan and explore more of this incredible
          country!
